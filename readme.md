# AOC 2025

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## Self imposed rules
- Can use Python standard library only.
- No use of any LLM's (chats, agents or co-pilot style suggestions). "Dumb" auto-complete acceptable.

## Other notes
- Not making inputs available (via .gitignore) due to request not to do so in the AoC "About" page (these are in the root folder as e.g., `day1_input.txt`)
- Might or might not bother tidying up code/solution after getting it right the first time around.
